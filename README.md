# The-Mystery
Please download all the files and run the Game3 in your python IDLE in your local machine to play.
This game was created by me and my friend or partner for my school project.
Its a text based game which has commands like move, inspect and use. 
Lastly, you have to download all the files and keep them in one folder as they are connected. 
Then, execute the Game3 file in order to start and play.
